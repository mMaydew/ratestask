Start date and time - 2021-07-30 20:49

Using flask as the framework with psycopg2 for db queries. Will end up using os.environ for db password and IP.
I'm going to host both the db and api in docker containers. I will need to make a docker-compose file but for now I will focus on the api.

I need to sanitise the parameters that are passed, basic regex should do the trick based on the data that I've seen.
Regex pattern: "[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+" alphanumeric with underscores and dashes. This allows for date, code, and slug.

Before regex I should filter the parameters so we only use the ones that are specified in the task.
I think dictionary comprehension is the best option here.

Since the data will end up in JSON format I can use postgres to present me the data in JSON which will cut processing time and will only return 1 row of data
if I set up the query in a smart way.

If I search with ports.code, ports.parent_slug, and regions.parent_slug I don't have to check what kind of format the location given is in.


I will update the README at the end as there is a good amount to change there.


If a location doesn't exist I should return a 400 error with a message saying the location doesn't exist.
But if there is no data for an existing location I should just return an empty array. (Getting ahead of myself slightly, but it's noted for later)

I think there might be a cleaner way to implement the location code check, I will think about it later.
